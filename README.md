# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
**Development of a Diabetes Prediction Model**, covering key steps from data collection to model optimization and deployment. Our goal is to create an accurate and reliable tool to help healthcare professionals and patients make informed decisions regarding diabetes risk. **STEPS**:

1. **Importing a Preprocessed Dataset** from Kaggle or a similar source containing relevant patient health records and diabetes data.
2. **Cleaning the Data** to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistency.
3. **Checking Relationships** between diabetes risk and different parameters (age, BMI, glucose level, insulin, etc.).
4. **Plotting Graphs** to visualize the relationships and identify trends between different variables and the target (diabetes occurrence).
5. **Applying Train-Test Split** to divide the data for model training and evaluation.
6. **Logistic Regression Model** or other classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).
7. **Making a Pipeline** to streamline data preprocessing and model building.
8. **Fitting the Model** on the training data and evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.
9. **The Python notebook** for the project has been mentioned in the Code section.

A **Power BI dashboard** was created for interactive visualizations and insights, referencing the Python analysis file.
